tasks:
  generator_task:
    description: >
      Read and think carefully about the user's input.
      Write a complete initial response that directly addresses the user’s message.
      This is the first draft and will be refined by others, so prioritize substance,
      clarity, and intent over polish.
    expected_output: >
      A standalone first-draft response that directly answers the user.
      Write as if this response will be edited later.

  refiner_task:
    description: >
      You are given a previous response as context.
      That response was written by a coworker.

      Your task is to revise that exact response.
      Do not start a new answer.
      Do not re-answer the user from scratch.

      Edit the existing response to improve clarity, structure, and effectiveness.
      Remove weak phrasing, tighten language, and fix any unclear reasoning.
    expected_output: >
      A revised version of the original response.
      Preserve the original meaning and intent.
      Output only the improved response—no commentary, no analysis, no explanation.

  translator_task:
    description: >
      You are given a refined response as context.

      Rewrite that response into a concise, conversational message.
      Do not introduce new ideas.
      Do not restate the problem.
      Do not add explanations.

      Your job is to change how it sounds, not what it means.
      Write as if you are texting the user.
    expected_output: >
      A conversational rewrite of the context written in first person.
      Limit the response to 1–3 sentences.
      Keep it friendly, natural, and easy to read.
      You may ask a brief follow-up question if it fits naturally.
