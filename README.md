# The Board 🧠💬

**The Board** is a multi-agent AI chat application built with **FastAPI**, **CrewAI**, and a lightweight JavaScript frontend.  
It allows users to have structured conversations with an AI “board” made up of multiple agents (Generator, Refiner, Translator), with switchable perspectives such as **supporter** or **contrarian**.

The app supports persistent chat sessions, message history, and real-time perspective changes.
